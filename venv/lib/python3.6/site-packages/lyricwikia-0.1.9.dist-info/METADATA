Description
-----------

`LyricWikia`_ is an online wiki-based lyrics database and encyclopedia.
It used to provide full access to song lyrics via API, but the service
has been discontinued.

This API scrapes the song web page and returns the lyrics. Please verify
that your use complies with the `LyricWikia`_ terms of service.

The package ``lyricwikia`` is on `PyPI`_, so you can install it using pip:

API
---

At the moment ``lyricwikia`` provides two APIs that are not officially already
provided by the official APIs):

- ``get_lyrics(artist, song, linesep='\n', timeout=None)``: returns a string
    that contains the lyrics of the song as provided by LyricWikia. If the
    lyrics is not found, the ``LyricsNotFound`` exception is raised.

- ``get_all_lyrics(artist, song, linesep='\n', timeout=None)``: returns a list
  of all the lyrics versions of the song (e.g., both the *kanji* and the
  *romaji* versions if available).  If the lyrics is not found, the
  ``LyricsNotFound`` exception is raised.


.. code:: python

    import lyricwikia
    lyrics = lyricwikia.get_lyrics('Led Zeppelin', 'Stairway to heaven')
