- Downloads songs from YouTube in an MP3 format by using Spotify's HTTP link.
- Can also download a song by entering its artist and song name (in case if you don't have the Spotify's HTTP link for some song).
- Automatically applies metadata to the downloaded song which includes:

  - `Title`, `Artist`, `Album`, `Album art`, `Lyrics` (if found on [lyrics wikia](http://lyrics.wikia.com)), `Album artist`, `Genre`, `Track number`, `Disc number`, `Release date`, and more...

- Works straight out of the box and does not require you to generate or mess with your API keys (already included).

Below is how your music library will look!

## Installation

❗️ **This tool works only with Python 3.**

Python 2 compatibility was dropped because of the way it deals with unicode (2020 is coming soon too).
If you still need to use Python 2 - check out the (outdated)
[python2](https://github.com/ritiek/spotify-downloader/tree/python2) branch.

spotify-downloader works with all major distributions and even on low-powered devices such as a Raspberry Pi.

spotify-downloader can be installed via pip with:
```console
$ pip3 install spotdl
```

but be sure to check out the [Installation](https://github.com/ritiek/spotify-downloader/wiki/Installation) wiki
page for detailed OS-specific instructions to get it and other dependencies it relies on working on your system.

## Usage

For the most basic usage, downloading tracks is as easy as

```console
$ spotdl --song https://open.spotify.com/track/2DGa7iaidT5s0qnINlwMjJ
$ spotdl --song "ncs - spectre"
```

For downloading playlist and albums, you need to first load all the tracks into text file and then pass
this text file to `--list` argument. Here is how you would do it for a playlist

```console
$ spotdl --playlist https://open.spotify.com/user/nocopyrightsounds/playlist/7sZbq8QGyMnhKPcLJvCUFD
INFO: Writing 62 tracks to ncs-releases.txt
$ spotdl --list ncs-releases.txt
```
